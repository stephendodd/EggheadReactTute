import React from 'react'

//One way of declaring a component where the component can have state.
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello world</div>
  }
}

//Another method for declaring a component where the component is stateless
//const App = () => <h1>Hello world</h1>

export default App
